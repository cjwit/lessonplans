# Sub Plans

## Individual Classes and Ensembles

### Concert Choir

The first day I usually go over the expectations and syllabus. On the syllabus I make sure that the students have the concert dates for the year. I tell them they have no excuse not to be available for the concerts and that their grade automatically becomes a 65 if they do not attend the concert. The only acceptable excuse for missing a concert is a family emergency or a severe illness and they must provide documentation to support this.

The next few days I use the time to test ranges in small groups and assign voice parts. Feel free to do whatever you wish, but last year I divided the girls as evenly as I could and then had them switch back and forth being altos and sopranos in the music so that they had the opportunity to work on singing harmony as well as exercising their upper and lower ranges. This also prevents the “but I’m an alto” or “I only sing soprano” syndrome.

All County Auditions – I usually start by teaching the All County piece to the whole choir. This year’s piece is Mon Coeur se Recommande a vous – Lassus. We have a few copies in the cabinet and you will need to make copies so that everyone can have one. I do not know the measures that they are using yet, but will forward the email along as soon as I hear. If you need assistance with the pronunciation of the French, ask Bailey DiSanto to help you. The students audition in quartets – one per voice part. They will be given their starting pitches but then will have to start and stop together. Auditions are October 26 at North Rose Wolcott and the chairperson is Christine Schwind. After all the students have learned the song, I usually ask who is interested in auditioning and then begin bringing them in for lessons to work on it in quartets.

I have put together repertoire lists for the year, but please feel free to change them as you wish. All the music for the year was ordered and should be in the room in J.W. Pepper boxes. If you’re missing something check with Patrick as it may be mixed in with his boxes. Also, during my last maternity leave some of the filing got a little mixed up. If you can’t find a piece that I mention being in the cabinets, feel free to replace it with something else.

Lessons – Usually concert choir kids get a few lessons a marking period, but this year your schedule only gives you one lesson per day. You will need that time to prep cabarets, All County auditions and All County so I would not plan on the concert choir kids getting a ton of lessons in if any at all.

### Select Choir

My select choir had quite a bit of turnover, particularly in the soprano section, this year. You will probably need to do some significant work on blend and singing as an ensemble in the beginning, but their first concert is the Cabaret concert in October. For this concert, they usually do two or three pieces as a group, one guys piece, a girls piece, and each of them has the opportunity to do a solo (but only if they want to). Solos have to be able to be purchased on musicnotes.com. Talk to main office about how they want you to purchase the music. I know they used textbook money at one point.

### Performing Arts I  

I start by playing a LOT of improv games. I left the teachers handbook of the book I love and the Viola Spolin book on the desk. These are great starting spots. Start with a bunch of icebreakers so that the class can get comfortable with each other and don’t let them play games where they talk too soon. Physicality is far more important than words in the beginning. There is a plastic bin in the closet next to the desk that is full of the game cards referenced in the teachers handbook.

After you’ve built some improv skills, spend some time talking about/teaching the concepts of blocking a scene, memorizing a scene, subtext and character development. Then assign each student a monologue. I usually use the one-minute monologues book for these. The monologues are easier and short and I can give harder ones to the students who need a challenge and easier ones to those who I think will struggle. I give them class time to work on the monologues and I travel around helping them with them. I also do a round robin day where they perform for each other in groups of three or four and give each other some feedback prior to the “graded” performance day.

I always put all their names in a bowl and draw them out at random on performance day. That way they all have to be prepared but cannot “volunteer” to get a friend who is unprepared out of performing that day. I know it sounds silly, but that has been a problem in the past. I also use monologue day as an opportunity to teach verbal critique. Three or four students are asked to comment on the performance at its conclusion. The first person needs to offer positive feedback. The second offers constructive criticism. The last two can offer either types of feedback.

Now that the students have some skills from their monologues, I put them in groups and give them a scene to work on. For this I use the Scenes that Really Happen books. The students read through their scene, block it, memorize it and do character development. Performance day looks the same as the last one I described.

After scene study, I give them a more difficult monologue. There is a book on the shelf called Monologues in Dialect that I use for this. I just ignore the dialect piece of it. This is where we get into the heart of some more serious teaching. After they’ve worked on it and performed it for the class, I give them three specific things to work on. They perform the monologue again a week later and I grade them on their ability to improve those three specific things. This allows each of them to work on bad habits, improve their timing or work on becoming a character.

The next section of the class focuses on playwriting. Have the students read through a few short plays (See the purple One Act Plays book) and diagram the sections of the play (exposition, inciting incident, point of attack, rising action, climax/crisis, denouement, conclusion). Then read one full-length play out loud as a class. I usually use The Philadelphia Story and supplement with the old Katherine Hepburn movie. After analyzing what makes a good play, the class writes their own play. Every student must have a role in the play and it must be appropriate for school. When the play has been written, workshopped and edited as necessary, begin rehearsing it. You will function as director. The students should collect necessary props and provide costumes for themselves. I usually do not raid the costume closets for this as things have a habit of disappearing. At the end of the rehearsal process, I try to either have the students perform the play for someone or we film it so that the students can write a self-assessment.

The last unit of the year is the Shakespeare unit. We do a brief history of Shakespeare and a study of the differences between comedy and tragedy. The students read A Midsummer Night’s Dream out loud as a class. I interrupt frequently to help them understand what is happening and also supplement with the 1999 movie to help them. When they’ve concluded reading Midsummer, we spend a few days in the computer lab selecting a Shakespearean monologue of their own. For their final exam, they present a brief synopsis of the play that the monologue is from, explain what happened right before their monologues, where they are and who they are talking to and then perform their monologue from memory.

### Performing Arts II

Begin by reviewing the parts of the play (exposition, inciting incident, point of attack, rising action, climax/crisis, denouement, conclusion). Read several of the short plays from the One Act Play book out loud and diagram them.  Then read The Importance of Being Earnest out loud as a class. I use the Reese Witherspoon/Colin Firth movie along with this to help them understand what is happening. The next piece of this is one of the trickiest of the class. Each student writes their own ten to fifteen page play. They must have a character for all the other students in the class. They must have a plot that contains all the parts of a play. They must include stage directions, etc.

I break this project into sections. First they brainstorm three plot ideas and present them to me. I help them pick one in individual conference sessions. Then they turn in a character list and character description for each of their characters. Then I have them write two pages of the climax/crisis and turn it in for feedback. Two pages are due at regular intervals after that until they have a complete play. Then they work in partners to read each other’s work and provide feedback. After edits, I have them turn it in and I offer feedback. Then we read each play out loud as a class and provide more feedback. Then a final copy is due and graded.

After all the plays are written and completed to my satisfaction, each student takes their turn directing, staging, designing lighting and performing their play. The entire process takes between 2-3 weeks per student director. At the conclusion of each play, the cast grades the director, the director writes a self-assessment and I grade them all.

Next I do a unit on special effects make-up – bruises, scars, etc. Take the time to warn the nurse when you are doing this, because people get really freaked out when kids start wandering the halls with black eyes and bloody scars. We have bruise wheels and liquid latex and fake blood. It’s super fun and they love it. Have them spend some time watching youtube videos. You would not believe the things they can learn that way. If you run out of anything, it can either be ordered on amazon or can be bought locally at Arlene’s Costume Shop in Irondequoit.

Lastly, I find a play that suits the make up of the class – 8 women, 7 men – whatever. They spend a chunk of time doing a very in-depth character analysis. As a final project for the year, we rehearse and perform the play. I’ve always wanted to perform it in an evening for their parents and friends but have never been able to make that happen.

### Music in Our Lives

I’m going to attach the [scope and sequence](CourseDocs/MusicinOurLivesHSScopeSequence.pdf) for the year, but I left you the textbook that the course is based on.

I start by teaching the 1920s – rhythm and blues, tin pan alley, country – and move through the decades studying culture and popular music. I have articles and documentaries marked in the scope and sequence if you would like to use them.

The students’ final exam project is to teach a modern artist of their choice to the class.

### Music Theory  

There are Alfred music theory books on the shelf. I’m sorry that they aren’t on the desk! I wasn’t aware that this course was running when I left the books. I start with book one and work through book one and book two of the Alfred. Usually, I spend Monday and Wednesday of each week working on theory, Tuesday and Thursday working on aural skills (sight reading, dictation, listening) and Friday as a music history day. I use the ipads for the students to do composition and record music. All of the apps on the ipads are pretty awesome for composition. Most (if not all) of the ipads have an aural skills app as well.


### iPads  

The iPads all have a passcode on them. The passcode is 3424. There are four new ipads that haven’t been set up yet. Feel free to use them in any class you want. They were bought by the vocal music department. Sometimes, other staff will ask if they can borrow them. This is fine as long as they come back to you and you have them when you need them.

## Concerts  

**October Cabaret**

For this concert, they usually do two to three pieces as a group, one guys piece, a girls piece, and each of them has the opportunity to do a solo (but only if they want to). Solos have to be able to be purchased on musicnotes.com. Talk to main office about how they want you to purchase the music. I know they used textbook money at one point.

I usually let the students choose two songs to purchase and try from musicnotes.com. If you select the “did not print correctly” button when you print them you can change the key a few times if necessary which is always helpful. Make the students choose pretty quickly because if you don’t some of them will drag their feet and then you won’t have much time to prep them for the concert. I usually use select choir time to work on the full ensemble music, lessons to work on solos, and then tenth period time to work on the guys and girls songs.

We charge $5 a ticket for this concert. The money raised from this concert goes into the theater club account and is used to pay for the accompanist for the rest of the year. Count it as a donation and then the paperwork is much easier.

**Winter Concert**

Select Choir performs three pieces on this concert. We begin working on them immediately following the Cabaret concert.

Concert Choir does four to five pieces.

**February Cabaret**

The concert is only Select Choir. Traditionally, this concert is only solos or duets. Follow the same procedure as the fall cabaret and begin preparation in January. I usually have the students select their music in December so that we can begin immediately when we return to school.

**District Concert**

Select Choir does one piece on this concert. It’s usually something very difficult so that it keeps their interest, but during this time period they are also prepping for the February Cabaret and the prism concert so boredom isn’t a huge issue.

Concert Choir does two pieces on this concert.

It is my turn to conduct a full district piece on this concert. Check with Christi and Erica to see if they would like you to do so. I have not chosen a piece for this yet.

**Prism Concert**

Select Choir usually does two to three pieces on this concert of a variety of styles.

**Awards Concert**

Select Choir does four pieces on this concert – two full ensemble, one guys piece and one girls piece.

Concert Choir also does four pieces on this concert – two full ensemble, one guys piece and one girls piece. Traditionally, the seniors in choir also choose a piece to perform. This piece is used at the concert, at baccalaureate if they wish and at graduation.

**Baccalaureate**

Oftentimes, the baccalaureate committee will ask the Select choir and/or the Senior choir (just the seniors in choir) to perform at this non-denominational Christian service celebrating graduation. I do not ever make them. We discuss it as a group and vote. If I have the correct number/the right parts, we perform. Otherwise, we don’t.

**Graduation**

See Baccalaureate because this is the same deal.

## Musical/Drama  

I initially picked the show Nice Work if You Can Get It. The script is in the big Tams Witmark box (which, incidentally, needs to be mailed back to Tams Witmark). I have not signed any contracts. You are more than welcome to choose another show. It’s up to you.

For the drama, I chose The Odd Couple (female version) as you have many talented girls and I’m not sure how many men will audition. Be aware that there are some racy jokes in this show that Williamson will probably not take kindly to. My plan was to edit out a few of the more suggestive ones as well as the swear words. Use your judgment or talk to Kate about it. Up to you. Again, I have not signed a contract so feel free to change the show. You are the only stipend position for the drama so you’re pretty much on your own unless someone wants to help you out of the good of their heart.

### Musical Stipend Positions

The district offers five stipend positions for the musical.

**Director** – which is you.

**Assistant Director** – Traditionally my former co-worker, Christy Hout, however, she is also planning on taking a year off so you will have this role to fill as you see fit. The stipend is about $700 for the whole show.

**Choreographer** – Jaime Akerley. Jaime is outstanding and she will help you with casting and the kids as she knows them well. (585) 415-7754

**Set Designer** – Despite this title, Dave Cocquyt does not actually design or build the sets for me. We use this stipend as a retainer where he makes sure that the sets the students and I build are safe and helps with any custom projects needed for that particular show. (Ex: The trolley in Meet Me in St. Louis)

**Accompanist** – Traditionally, Christine Schwind, however she has been on the fence about doing the show this year due to her two young children. You will have to call her and give her your hope as to her hours and see about her interest. Possibly you could supplement her salary with money from Arts in Ed? I don’t know but it might be worth checking into. If she is not interested, Patrick had some names you could consider. (315) 573-4108

### Non-Stipend Musical Roles

**Pit Band** – Patrick Tyler will conduct and put together the pit orchestra for you using the arts in ed funding. Make sure that your paperwork for arts in ed is in AT LEAST a month ahead of the show dates or they will not accept it. Patrick’s salary is also paid out of arts in ed money.

**Costumer** – Cheryl Distenfeld has done this for me for years. She is exceptional and also works very well with the kids. They love and adore her and she knows our closets like the back of her hand. I do not know if she is planning on doing the show but you should definitely call and ask. (585) 313-0508

### Costume Closets  

Costumes are stored everywhere. Welcome to a school with next to no storage.

#### Women’s Closets

The women’s closet is in the left hand closet of the choir room. This closet contains the bulk of the women’s costumes.

In the old tech booth above the auditorium there is closet full of gowns. The stairs are steep and treacherous. I suggest that you go up there as little as possible. See Pam for the key.

Backstage there are two wooden closets with padlocks. The combination is 27-9-31. The one on the right contains outerwear – coats, cloaks, and wedding gowns. The one on the left contains paint and painting supplies. The small gray cabinet in the middle has hats and headbands.

#### Men’s closets  

The men’s closet is in the right hand closet of the choir room. This closet contains the bulk of the men’s costumes.

There is also a cache of men’s items in the band wing in the back right room.

#### Shoes  

We own a HUGE collection of character and tap shoes. They are located in the closet room next to the desk in the large gray cabinet. At the beginning of the show, I have each of the girls find a pair that fits them and then we “sign them out” to them. Each pair of shoes has a number on the bottom. Make a list of which girl has which shoes and make sure they come back at the end of the production.

### Set Storage

Ask Dave to show you the wood closet. I apologize in advance. It’s as organized as it can be. It contains a number of things that may be useful to you. There are doors, platforms, stairs, windows, railings, and an extension that can be added onto the stage to extend the stage into the pit. Dave knows how most of it goes together, but Bailey and Drew DiSanto could be very helpful to you as well.

Some pieces are stored in the air conditioning room (behind the air conditioner). Dave has a key to this as well.

Some pieces are stored in the dressing rooms backstage.

Some pieces are stored on the back wall of the auditorium.

There are also huge pieces are carpet that we put underneath the pit orchestra to absorb sound and a large black wall that we put up around the pit.

### Stars of Tomorrow/ELENBEs

SOT and ELENBEs are awards shows for the musical and drama. I will forward you all the emails I receive about it, but feel free to email the organizers to get on the list yourself. Email or call me with any questions you have and I will answer them to the best of my ability.

## Piano and Accompaniment

We were donated a new piano last year. The piano was delivered right at the end of the year and did not have the opportunity to be tuned. Our tuner is Jeff Reimer. You should contact him and ask him to come tune the piano and install the humidifier that is in a box in the room. There is a lock on the piano to prevent damage. Our old piano was abused a lot so the lock really is necessary. I left my key to the piano lock on the key ring that is in the desk. Patrick also has one. Check with Pam to get Jeff’s contact information.

We use Christine Schwind to accompany our concerts. Her phone number is in the musical section. She is fabulous but she is a full time teacher at North Rose Wolcott so I mail her the music and she comes at 6 pm the night of the concert and that is our only rehearsal. If you are not comfortable with that, you could contact Kiera Carlson or Janet Follette to ask if they will play. Erica or Christi could give you contact information for them.

Payment – Our stipend for accompanists is terrible. It’s literally $20. We use the money raised by the October cabaret to pay the accompanist fees and I usually pay Christine $125 to play a concert.

## Conclusion

I’ve written up everything I can think of, but I know there will be more. My job is so quirky and a million little things will come up that you need or want answers to. Please feel free to get in touch about anything. I want you and the students to have a great year and I will do everything I can to help. I’m great at email and texting because I can answer when I have a free moment from the babies, but if I see you calling I will answer whenever I can.
